# Eye-Detection-Gender-Classification
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for a project focused on eye detection and gender classification using machine learning models. The project demonstrates the use of various classifiers to predict gender based on detected eye regions in images.

## Project Description

### Objective

The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate different machine learning models to classify gender based on eye detection. The key tasks include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Converting images to grayscale and resizing them to a standardized resolution.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Detecting eye regions in the images.
3. **Model Building**: Constructing and training machine learning models (CNN, MLP, KNN).
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## File Description

- **Eye-Detection-Gender-Classification.ipynb**: This is the main Jupyter Notebook file containing all the code, visualizations, and explanations for the project tasks.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need the following Python packages:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `opencv-python`
- `tensorflow`
- `scikit-learn`
- `jupyter`

**Observations:**
Precision: The precision for class 0 (label 0.0) is 0.82, which means that when the model predicts a data point as class 0, it is correct 82% of the time. For class 1 (label 1.0), the precision is 0.87, indicating that the model is 87% accurate when predicting class 1.

Recall: The recall for class 0 is 0.91, meaning that the model correctly identifies 91% of the actual class 0 instances. For class 1, the recall is 0.74, indicating that the model identifies 74% of the actual class 1 instances.

F1-score: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and is a measure of the model's accuracy in predicting both classes. The F1-score for class 0 is 0.86, and for class 1, it is 0.80.

Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model is 0.84, which means that it correctly predicts 84% of the total instances.

Without additional information about the second model and its evaluation metrics, we cannot make any observations or comparisons with the KNN classifier. If you can provide more details about the second model's evaluation metrics, I'd be happy to help analyze and compare both models.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, the exploratory data analysis (EDA) for eye detection by gender involved crucial preprocessing steps, such as converting the images to grayscale and resizing them to a standardized resolution of 48x48 pixels. These steps aimed to simplify the images and ensure uniformity, which can aid in subsequent eye detection and gender classification tasks. However, the specific evaluation metrics for the eye detection process were not provided, leaving room for further assessment of the accuracy and performance of the detection algorithm. Accurate eye detection is essential for reliable gender classification based on the detected eye regions. The combination of eye detection and gender classification holds promise in various applications, including facial recognition systems, human-computer interaction, and demographic analysis.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the eye detection and gender classification process, additional information is necessary. Knowing the specific eye detection algorithm employed and the accuracy of the gender classification model will be crucial in evaluating the overall effectiveness of the approach. Insights into potential challenges or limitations faced during the analysis will aid in refining the models and improving their performance. Furthermore, understanding eye patterns and gender distribution can yield valuable insights for real-world applications, helping researchers and practitioners tailor the algorithms to specific use cases.

Based on the provided evaluation metrics for the CNN, MLP, and KNN classifiers, we can draw insightful observations. The CNN demonstrated the highest overall accuracy of 0.88 and exhibited balanced performance with remarkable precision and recall values for both classes. The MLP model achieved an accuracy of 0.86 and demonstrated relatively balanced precision and recall. Meanwhile, the KNN classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.84, with a higher precision for class 1 but a higher recall for class 0. While the CNN emerged as the most effective classifier with its balanced performance, the other models also showed competitive results.

In summary, the initial steps of the eye detection by gender analysis laid a strong foundation, but further evaluation and refinement are necessary to unlock the full potential of the approach. The evaluation metrics offer valuable insights into the performance of the classifiers, guiding researchers and practitioners in selecting the most suitable model for their specific application. By continually improving the algorithms and understanding the underlying patterns, the field of eye detection by gender stands to make significant contributions in various domains, enhancing our interactions with technology and advancing demographic analysis.
